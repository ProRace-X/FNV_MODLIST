# ProRace's New Vegas Refreshed Modlist
Hello!
This is a modlist I've created over the years.

It's main goal is to enhance the vanilla game, most mods are mechanics and visual enhancements. 
Very few mods add content like map additions, quests or weapons, but some do. Those that do add things
are lore friendly.

Aside from the usual performance and stability improvements, you'll find shaders, textures, visual enhancements to
gunshots and multiple effects. The UI has been renewed as well and the pipboy has been turned into a handheld because I
think it matches the PA build I have better. 

More animations have been added as well, when eating, looting etc. and most well known mods like the B42 project are included.

I hope you all enjoy it!

ProRace
